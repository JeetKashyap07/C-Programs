All my projects while learning c programming

# ðŸ–¥ C-Programs

A collection of my **C programming practice codes** â€” starting from basics and moving toward conditionals, loops, math programs, and small projects.  
This repository is my way of documenting progress while learning C.

## â–¶ How to Run

### Using GCC directly
```
gcc filename.c -o program
./program

Example:
gcc factorial.c -o factorial
./factorial

make run FILE=filename.c
make clean
```
Whatâ€™s Inside

Basics â€“ simple input/output and starter codes
Conditionals â€“ if/else programs like odd-even, largest number checks
Loops â€“ sums, multiplication attempts, etc.
Math â€“ factorial, prime checker, and similar programs
